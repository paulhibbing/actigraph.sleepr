#' Apply the Sadeh algorithm
#'
#' The Sadeh sleep scoring algorithm is primarily used for younger
#' adolescents as the supporting research was performed on children
#' and young adults.
#' @param agdb A \code{tibble} (\code{tbl}) of activity data
#' (at least) an \code{epochlength} attribute. The epoch length must
#' be 60 seconds.
#' @inheritParams get_epoch_length
#' @param countname character. Name of the vertical axis column
#' @param ... arguments passed to \code{\link[internal applicator]{apply_sadeh_}}
#' @return A \code{tibble} (\code{tbl}) of activity data. A new column
#'  \code{sleep} indicates whether each 60s epoch is scored as asleep
#'  (S) or awake (W).
#' @details
#' The Sadeh algorithm requires that the activity data is in 60s
#' epochs and uses an 11-minute window that includes the five previous
#' and five future epochs. This function implements the algorithm as
#' described in the ActiGraph user manual.
#'
#' The Sadeh algorithm uses the y-axis (axis 1) counts; epoch counts
#' over 300 are set to 300. The sleep index (SI) is defined as
#'
#' \code{
#' SI = 7.601 - (0.065 * AVG) - (1.08 * NATS) - (0.056 * SD) - (0.703 * LG)
#' }
#'
#' where at epoch t
#'
#' \describe{
#'   \item{AVG}{the arithmetic mean (average) of the activity counts in
#'   an 11-epoch window centered at \code{t}}
#'   \item{NATS}{the number of epochs in this 11-epoch window which
#'   have counts >= 50 and < 100}
#'   \item{SD}{the standard deviation of the counts in a 6-epoch
#'   window that includes \code{t} and the five preceding epochs}
#'   \item{LG}{the natural (base e) logarithm of the activity at
#'   epoch \code{t}. To avoid taking the log of 0, we add 1 to the count.}
#' }
#'
#' The time series of activity counts is padded with zeros as
#'  necessary, at the beginning and at the end, to compute the three
#'  functions AVG, SD, NATS within a rolling window.
#'
#' Finally, the sleep state is asleep (S) if the sleep index SI
#' is greater than -4; otherwise the sleep state is awake (W).
